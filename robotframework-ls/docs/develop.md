Developing
-----------

Install NodeJs (https://nodejs.org/en/) -- make sure that `node` and `npm` are in the `PATH`.

Install Yarn (https://yarnpkg.com/) -- make sure that `yarn` is in the `PATH`.

Download the sources, head to the root directory (where `package.json` is located)
and run: `yarn install`.

After this step, it should be possible to open the `roboframework-lsp` folder in VSCode and launch
`Extension: Roboframework-lsp` to have a new instance of VSCode with the loaded extension.


Building a VSIX locally
------------------------

To build a VSIX, follow the steps in https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension
(if everything is setup, `vsce package` from the root directory should do it).

[Node.JS 12](https://nodejs.org/es/blog/release/v12.13.0/) is required.

1. `yarn install`
2. `npm install -g vsce`
3. `pip install fire`
4. `python -m dev vendor-robocorp-ls-core`
5. `python -m dev vendor-robotframework-interactive`
6. `vsce package`

New version release
--------------------

To release a new version:

- Open a shell at the proper place (something as `X:\vscode-robot\robotframework-lsp\robotframework-ls`)

- Create release branch (`git branch -D release-robotframework-lsp&git checkout -b release-robotframework-lsp`)

- Update version (`python -m dev set-version 0.27.0`).

- Update README.md to add notes on features/fixes (on `robotframework-ls` and `robotframework-intellij`).

- Update changelog.md to add notes on features/fixes and set release date (on `robotframework-ls` and `robotframework-intellij`).

- Update build.gradle version and patchPluginXml.changeNotes with the latest changelog (html expected).

- Push contents, get the build in https://github.com/robocorp/robotframework-lsp/actions and install locally to test.

- Rebase with master (`git checkout master&git rebase release-robotframework-lsp`).

- Create a tag (`git tag robotframework-lsp-0.27.0`) and push it.

- Send release msg. i.e.:

Hi @channel, `RobotFramework Language Server 0.27.0` is now available.

Changes in this release:

...

Official clients are available for `VSCode` and `Intellij` (alpha) (in the respective Marketplaces).
Other editors supporting language servers can get it with: `pip install robotframework-lsp`.

Note: the Intellij Marketplace can take some time to update, but it can be already installed manually from: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/XXX
